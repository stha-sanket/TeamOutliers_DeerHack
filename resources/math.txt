The chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of a composite function. 
For functions f(x) and g(x), the derivative of their composite (f ∘ g)(x) is:
(f ∘ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)

Example:
Let f(x) = x² and g(x) = 3x + 1
Then (f ∘ g)(x) = (3x + 1)²
Using chain rule:
f'(x) = 2x
g'(x) = 3
(f ∘ g)'(x) = 2(3x + 1) · 3 = 6(3x + 1)
